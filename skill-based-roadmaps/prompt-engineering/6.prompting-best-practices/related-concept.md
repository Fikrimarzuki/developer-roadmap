## Related Concept
- Provide few-shot examples for the structure or output style you need.
- Keep your prompts short and concise.
- Ask for structured output if it helps (e.g., JSON, XML, Markdown, CSV, etc).
- Use variables / placeholders in your prompts for easier configuration.
- Prioritize giving clearer instructions over adding too many constraints.
- Control the maximum output length.
- Experiment with input formats and writing styles.
- Tune sampling (temperature, top-k, top-p) for determinism vs creativity.
- Guard against prompt injection; sanitize user text.
- Automate evaluation, integrate unit tests for outputs.
- Document and track prompt versions.
- Optimize for latency and cost in production pipelines.
- Document decisions, failures, and learnings for future devs.
- Delimit different sections with triple backticks or XML tags.
