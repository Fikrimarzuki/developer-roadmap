# 🧭 Developer Roadmap Journey

This repository documents my journey to becoming a well-rounded software developer by following structured learning paths inspired by `roadmap.sh`.

I organize my learning into four main areas:

### 🧩 Languages
Notes and fundamentals for programming languages (JavaScript, Python, Rust, etc).

### 🛠 Projects
Hands-on practice projects where I implement what I learn (Node.js, FastAPI, Shopify, etc).

### 👨‍💻 Role-Based Roadmaps
Learning paths based on developer roles (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, Fullstack, etc).

### 🧠 Skill-Based Roadmaps
Core skills that apply across roles (Git, Design System, Shopify, etc).
